'''
Ask the user for two inputs: one a list of words and the other the order for the alien language.
Subject both inputs to lowercase characterisation.
Compare the words in the list to each other.
If the beginning letter of the first word is higher in the order than the second, immediately print false.
If the words all start with the same letter, check the second letter in the words from left to right to see whether the order is followed.
If it is not, print false again. 
If the order specified by the user is followed, print true.
